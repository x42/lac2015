<h2>Why should I sponsor LAC?</h2>
<p>
  The Linux Audio Conference is an annual free-of-charge event that is in its 13th year now. This international conference has been a meeting place for many of the world leaders in development and use of non-proprietary professional Audio Visual software.
</p>
<p>
  LAC has been the incubating event
  for many of the well-established Free and Open Source packages that have made a significant impact
  on the area, including the 
<a rel="external" href="http://jackaudio.org/">Jack Audio Connection Kit</a>, 
<a rel="external" href="http://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> and
<a rel="external" href="http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/">Qtractor</a>, 
  just to mention a few.
</p>
<p>
  Along the years, many important technologies were demonstrated at the conference, such as systems
  for spatial audio (Wave Field Synthesis, Ambisonics), networked audio and real-time processing.
  LAC also featured presentations by key people involved in Sound Synthesis research
  (<a rel="external" href="http://www.csounds.com/">Csound</a>, 
   <a rel="external" href="http://puredata.info/">Pure Data</a>, 
   <a rel="external" href="http://www.audiosynth.com/">SuperCollider</a>, etc.) and
  development of commercial products
  (<a rel="external" href="http://mixbus.harrisonconsoles.com/">Harrison Consoles</a>,
   <a rel="external" href="http://64studio.com/">64studio</a>, 
   <a rel="external" href="http://www.lionstracs.com/">Lionstracs</a>, 
   <a rel="external" href="http://www.trinityaudiogroup.com/">Trinity</a>, ...). It provides plenty of space 
  for developer discussions and - of course - concerts and music (of various flavours and genres).
  Recently, the conference has also been a host to the Open Video community
  (<a rel="external" href="http://lumiera.org/">lumiera</a>, 
   <a rel="external" href="http://openmovieeditor.org/">openmovieeditor</a>,
   <a rel="external" href="http://www.kdenlive.org/">kdenlive</a>,
   <a rel="external" href="http://www.kinodv.org/">kino</a>),
  expanding its range to incorporate visual technologies.
</p>
<p>
  In summary: LAC is the place for companies looking to interface with the non-proprietary pro-AV community,
  researchers, developers, artists and users.
