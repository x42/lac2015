<h1>Conference Material Download</h1>
<p>Moving along with the conference schedule, we're collecting slides and workshop-material to be made available for remote participants and later archiving.</p>
<p>Most slides are directly linked from the program-entry (click on the <a href="<?=local_url('program')?>">table-entry</a> or use the <a href="?page=program&amp;mode=list">list-view</a>). However due to diversity of the content, last-minute hand-ins and logistics, some files are dumped at <a href="<?=CANONICALURL?>download/"><?=CANONICALURL?>download/</a> indexed below:</p>
<?php
  dirlisttable('download');
